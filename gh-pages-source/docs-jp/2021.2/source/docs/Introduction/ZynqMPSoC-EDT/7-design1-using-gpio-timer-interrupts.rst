=====================================================
Design Example 1: Using GPIOs, Timers, and Interrupts
=====================================================

The Zynq |reg| UltraScale+ |trade| MPSoC ZCU102 evaluation board comes with a few configurable switches and LEDs. This design example makes use of bare-metal and Linux applications to toggle these LEDs, with the following details:

-  The Linux APU runs Linux, while the RPU R5-0 hosts another bare-metal application.

-  The Linux applications configure a set of PL LEDs to toggle using a PS dip switch, and another set of PL LEDs to toggle using a PL Dip
   Switch (SW17).

-  The R5-Core 0 application uses an AXI Timer IP in the programmable logic to toggle PS LED (DS50). The application is configured to
   toggle the LED state every time the timer counter expires, and the timer in the PL is set to reset periodically after a configurable
   time interval.

-  The system is configured so that the APU Linux application and RPU bare-metal application run simultaneously.

Configuring Hardware
--------------------

The first step in this design is to configure the PS and PL sections. This can be done in Vivado |reg| IP integrator. Start with adding the required IPs from the Vivado IP catalog, and then connect the components to blocks in the PS subsystem.

1. If the Vivado Design Suite is already open, start from the block diagram shown in and jump to step 4.

2. Open the Vivado project that you created in the introduction tutorial:

   ``C:/edt/edt_zcu102/edt_zcu102.xpr``

3. Save the project as ``design_example_1``:

   1. Click **File → Project → Save As**.
   2. Input project name **design_example_1**.
   3. Deselect **Include run results**.
   4. Click **OK**.

   .. image:: media/vivado_save_project_as.png

4. In the Flow Navigator, under IP integrator, click **Open Block Design** and select ``edt_zcu102.bd``.

   .. image:: ./media/image96.png

Adding the AXI Timer and AXI GPIO IP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Adding the AXI Timer IP:

   1. Right-click in the block diagram and select **Add IP** from the IP catalog.
   2. In the catalog, select **AXI Timer**. The IP Details information displays, as shown in the following figure.

      .. image:: ./media/image97.jpeg

   3. Double-click the **AXI Timer** IP to add it to the design.

2. Review the **AXI Timer** configurations:

   1. Double-click the **AXI Timer** IP block to configure the IP, as shown in following figure.

      .. image:: ./media/image98.png

   2. Click **OK** to close the window.

3. Add the **AXI GPIO** IP:

   1. Right-click in the block diagram and select **Add IP**.
   2. Search for “AXI GPIO” and double-click the **AXI GPIO** IP to add it to the design.

4. Add the second **AXI GPIO** IP:

   1. Copy the **axi_gpio_0** IP by typing **Ctrl+C**.
   2. Paste it by typing **Ctrl+V**.
   3. You can see that axi_gpio_1 is created.

5. Configure **axi_gpio_0** for push buttons:

   1. Double-click **axi_gpio_0** to open its configurations.
   2. Select **Push button 5bits** from the Board Interface drop-down list on the GPIO row.
   3. Click **OK**.

      .. image:: ./media/image99.png

6. Configure **axi_gpio_1** for PL LEDs:

   1. Double-click **axi_gpio_1** to open its configurations.
   2. Select **led_8bits** from the Board Interface drop-down list on the **GPIO** row.
   3. Click **OK**.

      .. image:: ./media/image100.png

Connecting IP Blocks to Create a Complete System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to connect the IP blocks instantiated above to the PS block.

-  Use PS HPM LPD AXI to control the AXI interface of the GPIO and timer.
-  Connect interrupt signals.

1. Enable the PS AXI HPM LPD AXI interface:

   1. Double-click the **Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC** IP block.
   2. Select the **PS-PL Configuration** tab.
   3. Enable **AXI HPM0 LPD**, expand it, and set the AXI HPM0 LPD Data Width drop-down to **32** bits.
   4. Click **OK** to close the window.
   5. Check that the M_AXI_HPM0_LPD interface shows up on the MPSoC block.

      .. figure:: ./media/image102.png
         :alt: AXI HPM LPD

         AXI HPM LPD

      .. note:: 32-bit AXI is useful for accessing the control registers of general IPs. 128-bit AXI is useful for data transfer.

2. Connect the AXI interfaces:

   1. Click **Run Connection Automation**.
   2. Check **All Automation**.
   3. Go through each tab to review the planning connections.
   4. Click **OK** to execute the automated connection.
   5. Check the connection result.

      .. figure:: media/vivado_gpio_auto_connection.png
         :alt: Vivado Connection Automation Result

         Vivado Connection Automation Result

3. Connect the interrupt signals:

   1. Connect axi_timer_0.interrupt to zynq_ultra_ps_e_0.pl_ps_irq0[0:0].
   2. The AXI GPIO interrupt mode will not be used.
   3. Review the final block diagram.

      .. figure:: media/design_example_1_block_diagram.png
         :alt: Final Block Diagram

         Final Block Diagram

   .. note:: If you have multiple interrupt signals to connect to the PS, you can concatenate them to a bus with a ``concat`` block. You
      can add ``concat`` from **Add IP**.

4. Verify the address settings of IP cores:

   In the Address Editor view, verify that the corresponding IPs are assigned addresses during connection automation. If they are not assigned, click the **Assign All** button to assign addresses for them.

   .. image:: ./media/image104.png

   .. note:: Connection automation assigns addresses automatically. If you connect IP manually, you also need to assign its address.

Exporting the Post-Implementation Hardware Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will run implementation of the Vivado design and export the post-implementation design. The Vivado generated bitstream will be included in the XSA file. It can make the software tests and boot image generation steps easier in the Vitis IDE. Note that the Vitis IDE also accepts pre-synthesis XSAs for application development. Bitstream is only required for debugging PL designs.

1. Validate the block diagram design:

   1. Return to the block diagram view.
   2. Save the block design (press **Ctrl+S**).
   3. Click the **Validate Design** button on the block diagram toolbar. Alternatively, press the **F6** key.

      It takes a while to validate the design. A message dialog box pops up and states “Validation successful. There are no errors or critical warnings in this design.” If it reports any errors or critical
      warnings, review the previous steps and correct the errors.

   4. Click **OK** to close the message.

2. Generate output products:

   1. Click **Generate Block Design** in the Flow Navigator panel.
   2. Click **Generate**.
   3. When the Generate Output Products process completes, click **OK**.
   4. In the Block Diagram Sources window, click the **IP Sources** tab. Here you can see the output products that you just generated, as
      shown in the following figure.

      .. image:: ./media/image106.png

3. Make sure you have an HDL top file. Because this design is saved from the introduction design, we have already done it.

4. Run synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation:

   1. Click **Generate Bitstream**.
   2. Vivado displays a popup message saying “There are no implementation results available. OK to launch synthesis and implementation?”. Click **Yes**.
   3. Review the **Launch Runs** dialogue, set the proper number of jobs to run simultaneously, and click **OK**.
   4. Wait for Vivado to complete implementation. After it finishes, a Bitstream Generation Completed message will pop up. Click **Cancel** to close it.

      .. figure:: media/vivado_launch_run.png
         :alt: Vivado Launch Run Configuration

         Vivado Launch Run Configuration

5. Export the hardware design:

   1. Select **File → Export → Export Hardware**. The Export Hardware Platform window opens.
   2. Click **Next**.
   3. Select **Include Bitstream** and click **Next**.
   4. Specify the XSA file name and path. This is kept at default in this example. Click **Next**.
   5. Review the summary and click **Finish** to close the window.
   6. The hardware platform XSA file is generated in the specified path.

Configuring Software
--------------------

This use case has a bare-metal application running on an R5 core and a Linux application running on an APU Linux target. Most of the software blocks will remain the same as mentioned in :doc:`Build Software for PS Subsystems <4-build-sw-for-ps-subsystems>`. The software for this design example requires additional drivers for components added in the PL. For this reason, you will need to generate a new bare-metal BSP in the Vitis IDE using the hardware files generated for this design. Linux also requires the Linux BSP to be reconfigured in sync with the new hardware platform file (XSA).

+-----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
| Processor       | Domain          | Application              |
+=================+=================+==========================+
| Cortex-A53      | Linux           | ps_pl_linux_app          |
+-----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
| Cortex-R5_0     | Standalone      | tmr_psled_r5             |
+-----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+

Before you configure the software, first look at the application design scheme. The system has a bare-metal application on RPU, which starts with toggling the PS LEDs for a configurable period. The LEDs are set to toggle in synchronization with a PL AXI Timer running in the PL block. The application sets the AXI Timer in the generate mode and generates an interrupt every time the Timer count expires. The application is designed to toggle the PS LED state after handling the Timer interrupt.

The application runs in an infinite while loop and sets the RPU in WFI mode after toggling the LEDs for the configured time period. This LED toggling sequence can be repeated again by getting the RPU out of WFI mode using an external interrupt. For this reason, the UART interrupt is also configured and enabled in the same application. While this application runs on the RPU, the Linux target also hosts another Linux application. The Linux application uses user input from the PS or PL switches to toggle PL LEDs. This Linux application also runs in an infinite while loop, waiting for user input to toggle the PL LEDs. The next set of steps shows how to configure system software and build user applications for this design.

Configuring and Building Linux Using PetaLinux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create the Linux images using PetaLinux. The Linux images must be created in sync with the hardware configuration for this design. You will also need to configure PetaLinux to create images for SD boot.

2. Repeat steps 2 to 4 as described in :ref:`creating-a-petalinux-image` to update the device tree and build Linux images using PetaLinux.

3. Follow instructions in :ref:`verifying-the-image-on-the-zcu102-board` to verify the images.

   Make sure you have the following files for creating the Linux domain:

      - `fsbl.elf`
      - `pmufw.elf`
      - `bl31.elf`
      - `rootfs.ext4`
      - `Image`
      - `system.dtb`

   +----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------+

4. Click **Finish**.

   The New Project wizard closes and the Vitis IDE creates the tmr_psled_r5 application project, which you can view in the Project Explorer.

5. In the Project Explorer tab, expand the **tmr_psled_r5** project.

6. Right-click the **src** directory, and select **Import** to open the Import dialog box.

7. Expand General in the Import dialog box and select **File System**.

8. Click **Next**.

9. Select **Browse** and navigate to the ``ref_files/design1`` folder.

10. Click **OK**.

11. Select and add the **timer_psled_r5.c** file.

12. Click **Finish**.

The Vitis IDE automatically builds the application and displays the status in the console window.

Modifying the Linker Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In the Project Explorer, expand the tmr_psled_r5 project.

2. In the ``src`` directory, double-click ``lscript.ld`` to open the linker script for this project.

3. In the linker script in Available Memory Regions, modify the following attributes for **psu_r5_ddr_0_MEM_0**:

   Base Address: ``0x70000000`` 
   Size: ``0x10000000``

   The following figure shows the linker script modification. The following figure is for representation only. Actual memory region might vary in case of isolation settings.

   .. image:: ./media/image36.png

   This modification in the linker script ensures that the RPU bare-metal application resides above ``0x70000000`` base address in the DDR memory, and occupies no more than 256 MB of size.

4. Type **Ctrl+S** to save the changes.

5. Modify the BSP to configure UART with UART_1. For more information, see :ref:`modifying-the-board-support-package-for-testapp_r5`.

6. Right-click the **tmr_psled_r5** project and select **Build Project**.

7. Verify that the application is compiled and linked successfully and that the ``tmr_psled_r5.elf`` file is generated in the ``tmr_psled_r5\Debug`` folder.

Creating the Linux Domain for Linux Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a Linux domain for generating Linux applications, follow these steps:

1. In the Explorer view of the Vitis IDE, expand the edt_zcu102_wrapper platform project.

2. Double-click **platform.spr** in the Explorer view to open the platform explorer.

3. Click |image1| in the top right hand corner to add the domain.

4. When the new domain window opens, enter the following details:

   -  Name: Linux_Domain
   -  Display name: Linux_Domain
   -  OS: Linux
   -  Processor: psu_cortexa53
   -  Supported runtimes: C/C++
   -  Architecture: 64-bit
   -  Bif file: Provide a sample bif file.
   -  Boot Component Directory: Create a boot directory and provide the path.
   -  Linux Image Directory: Provide the same boot directory path.

5. Build the platform to make the domain change take effects.

Creating the Linux Application Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In the Vitis IDE, select **File → New → Application Project**. The New Project wizard opens.

2. Use the information in the table below to make your selections in the wizard.

   +----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
   | Screen               | System Properties    | Settings                |
   +======================+======================+=========================+
   | Platform             | Select platform from | edt_zcu102_wrapper      |
   |                      | repository           |                         |
   +----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
   | Application project  | Application project  | ps_pl_linux_app         |
   | details              | name                 |                         |
   +----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
   |                      | System project name  | ps_pl_linux_app_system  |
   +----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
   |                      | Target processor     | psu_cortexa53 SMP       |
   +----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
   | Domain               | Domain               | Linux_Domain            |
   +----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
   | Templates            | Available templates  | Linux Empty Application |
   +----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+

   Since we have already created the Linux domain on psu_cortexa53, it shows up in the target processor list. If you’d like to create the domain during application creation process, you need to check “Show all processors in the hardware specification” to let the wizard show all processors. By default, it only shows the processors that have been used by the domains in the platform.

3. Click **Finish**.

   The New Project wizard closes and the Vitis IDE creates the ps_pl_linux_app application project, which can be found in the Project Explorer view.

4. In the Project Explorer view, expand the **ps_pl_linux_app** project.

5. Right-click the ``src`` directory, and select **Import** to open the Import view.

6. Expand General in the Import dialog box and select **File System**.

7. Click **Next**.

8. Select **Browse** and navigate to the **ref_files/design1** folder.

9. Click **OK**.

10. Select and add the **ps_pl_linux_app.c** file.

    .. note:: The application might fail to build because of a missing reference to the pthread library. The next section shows how to add the pthread library.

.. _modifying-the-build-settings:

Modifying the Build Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application makes use of pthreads from the pthread library. Add the pthread library as follows:

1. Right-click **ps_pl_linux_app**, and click **C/C++ Build Settings**.

2. Refer to the following figures to add the pthread library.

   .. image:: ./media/image110.jpeg

   .. image:: ./media/image111.png

3. Click **OK** in both the windows.

4. Right-click the application and select **Build** to build the application.

Creating a Boot Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that all the individual images are ready, you will create the boot image to load all of these components on a Zynq UltraScale+ device. This can be done using the Create Boot Image wizard in the Vitis IDE by performing the following steps. This example creates a boot image `BOOT.bin` in ``C:\edt\design1``.

1. Launch the Vitis IDE, if it is not already running.

2. Set the workspace based on the project you created in :doc:`Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Processing System Configuration <3-system-configuration>`. For example: ``C:\edt``.

3. Select **Xilinx → Create Boot Image**.

4. In the Create Boot Image wizard, add the settings and partitions as shown in the following figure.

   .. note:: For detailed steps on how to add partitions, see :ref:`boot-sequence-for-sd-boot`.

   .. image:: ./media/image112.png

   .. note:: This boot image requires PL bitstream ``edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit`` (Partition Type - Datafile, Destination Device - PL). The bitstream partition needs to be added right after the bootloader while you create the boot image. The R5 application ``tmr_psled_r5.elf`` is added as partition in this boot image.

5. After adding all the partitions, click **Create Image**.

   .. important:: Ensure that you have set the correct exception levels for Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) (EL-3, TrustZone) and U-Boot (EL-2) partitions. These settings can be ignored for other partitions.

Running the Image on a ZCU102 Board
-----------------------------------

Preparing the SD Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the images and executables onto an SD card and load it into the SD card slot in the board.

1. Copy the ``BOOT.bin`` and ``image.ub`` files to an SD card.

   .. note:: ``BOOT.bin`` is located in ``C:\edt\design1``.

2. Copy the Linux application, ``ps_pl_linux_app.elf``, to the same SD card. The application can be found in ``C:\edt\ps_pl_linux_app\Debug``.

Target Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Load the SD card into the ZCU102 board, in the J100 connector.

2. Connect the USB-UART on the board to the host machine.

3. Connect the Micro USB cable into the ZCU102 Board Micro USB port J83, and the other end into an open USB port on the host machine.

4. Configure the board to boot in SD boot mode by setting switch SW6 as shown in the following figure.

   .. image:: ./media/image43.jpeg

5. Connect 12V power to the ZCU102 6-Pin Molex connector.

6. Start a terminal session, using Tera Term or Minicom depending on the host machine being used, as well as the COM port and baud rate for your system.

7. For port settings, verify the COM port in the device manager. There are four USB-UART interfaces exposed by the ZCU102 board.

8. Select the COM port associated with the interface with the lowest number. In this case, for UART-0, select the COM port with interface-0.

9. Similarly, for UART-1, select the COM port with interface-1. Remember that the R5 BSP has been configured to use UART-1, so R5 application messages will appear on the COM port with the UART-1 terminal.

Power On Target and Run Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Turn on the ZCU102 board using SW1, and wait until Linux loads on the board.

   You can see the initial boot sequence messages on your terminal screen representing UART-0. The terminal screen configured for UART-1
   also prints a message. This is the print message from the R5 bare-metal application running on the RPU, configured to use the UART-1 interface. This application is loaded by the FSBL onto the RPU.

2. Now that this application is running, notice the PS LED is being toggled by the application, and follow the instructions in the application terminal.

   .. image:: ./media/image113.png

Running Linux Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After Linux is up on the ZCU102 system, log into the Linux target with login: root and password: root. The Linux target is now ready to run applications. Run the Linux application by performing the following
steps.

1. Copy the application from the SD card mount point to ``/tmp``:

   .. code::

      # cp /run/media/mmcblk0p1/ps_pl_linux_app.elf /tmp

   .. note:: 
   
      Mount the SD card manually if you fail to find SD card contents in this location.
      
      .. code::
      
         # mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/. 
         
      Copy the application to ``/tmp``. 
      
      .. code:: 
      
         # cp /media/ps_pl_linux_app.elf /tmp

2. Run the application.

   .. code::
   
      # /tmp/ps_pl_linux_app.elf

   .. image:: ./media/image114.png

.. _reference-design-automation:

Reference Design Automation
---------------------------

The `ref_design <https://github.com/Xilinx/Embedded-Design-Tutorials/tree/master/docs/Introduction/ZynqMPSoC-EDT/ref_files/design1>`_ for this example provides not only the source code for applications, but also a Makefile to run
through the design generation process. To generate the binaries, run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   cd ref_files/design1
   make all

Summary
-------

In this design example, you created the hardware design in Vivado with processing system and GPIO modules. The hardware was exported to an XSA file. You imported the hardware to PetaLinux to update the device tree. The regenerated PetaLinux image can boot the board. You also imported the XSA to the Vitis software platform to create the platform project and developed software for Arm Cortex-R5F. You finally created the boot image to include software binaries to run on both the APU and RPU to make the system perform as planned.

The :doc:`next chapter <./8-boot-and-configuration>` introduces more boot and configuration techniques.
