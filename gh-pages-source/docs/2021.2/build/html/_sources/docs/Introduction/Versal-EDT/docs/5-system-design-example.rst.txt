System Design Example using Scalar Engine and Adaptable Engine
**************************************************************

This chapter guides you through building a system based on Versal |reg| devices using available tools and supported software blocks. This chapter demonstrates how to use the Vivado |reg| tool to create an embedded design using PL AXI GPIO and PL AXI UART. It also describes how to configure and build the Linux operating system for an Arm |reg| Cortex |trade|-A72 core-based APU on a Versal ACAP device.

Examples using the PetaLinux tool are provided in this chapter.

.. _using-axi-gpio:

==============================
Design Example: Using AXI GPIO
==============================

The Linux application uses a PL-based AXI GPIO interface to monitor the DIP switch of the board and accordingly control the LEDs on the board. The LED application can run on both the VMK180 and the VCK190 boards.

The RPU application uses the PL-based AXI UART lite to print the debug messages on the AXI UART console instead of using the PS UART console. The PL UART application can run on both the VMK180 and VCK190 boards.

Configuring Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step in this design is to configure the PS and PL sections. You can do this using the Vivado IP integrator. Start with adding the required IPs from the Vivado IP catalog and then connect the components to blocks in the PS subsystem. To configure the hardware, follow these steps:

.. note:: If the Vivado Design Suite is open already, jump to step 3.

1. Open the Vivado project you created in :doc:`../docs/2-cips-noc-ip-config`.

   `C:/edt/edt_versal/edt_versal.xpr`

2. In the Flow Navigator, under **IP Integrator**, click **Open Block Design**.

   .. image:: ./media/image5.png

3. Right-click the block diagram and select **Add IP**.

Connecting IP Blocks to Create a Complete System
------------------------------------------------

To connect IP blocks to create a system, follow these steps.

1. Double-click the Versal ACAP CIPS IP core.

2. Click **PS-PMC→ PL-PS Interfaces**.

   .. image:: ./media/image60.png

3. Enable the M_AXI_FPD interface and set the **Number of PL Resets** to 1, as shown in the previous figure.

4. Click **Clocking**, and then click on the Output Clocks tab.

5. Expand PMC Domain Clocks. Then expand PL Fabric Clocks. Configure the PL0_REF_CLK to 300 MHz as shown in the following figure:

   .. image:: ./media/image61.png

6. Click **Finish** and **OK** to complete the configuration and return to the block diagram.

Adding and Configuring IP Addresses
-----------------------------------

To add and configure IP addresses, follow these steps.

1. Right-click the block diagram and select **Add IP** from the IP catalog.

2. Search for AXI GPIO and double-click the **AXI GPIO IP** to add it to your design.

23. Add four more instances of Slice IP.

24. Delete the external pins of the AXI GPIO IP and expand the interfaces.

25. Connect the output pin gpio_io_0 of axi_gpio_0 to slice 0 and slice 1.

26. Similarly, connect the output pin gpio_io_0 of axi_gpio_1 to slice 2 and slice 3.

27. Make the output of Slice IP as External.

28. Configure each Slice IP as shown below.

    .. image:: ./media/image69.png

    .. image:: ./media/image70.png

    .. image:: ./media/image71.png

    .. image:: ./media/image72.png

29.	Double-click **axi_uartlite_0** to open the IP.

30. In the Board tab, set Board interface as shown below:

    .. image:: media/board-interface.png
    
31. Go to the IP Configuration tab and configure the settings as shown in the following figure.

    .. image:: media/configure-ip-settings.png

32. Add **Clock Wizard IP**. Double-click to open the IP.

33. Go to Clocking Features tab and set the configuration as shown below:

    .. image:: media/clocking-features.png

34. Make sure the Source option in **Input Clock Information** is set to **Global buffer**.
    
35. Go to Output clocks tab and configure as follows:

    .. image:: media/output-clocks-tab.png

36. Right-click `pl0_ref_clk` of CIPS and click **Disconnect Pin**.

37. Connect the `pl0_ref_clk` from CIPS to input `clk_in1` of the Clocking wizard.

38. Connect the output of clocking wizard to `slowest_sync_clock` of Processor System Reset IP.

    This will help in avoiding timing failure.
