**********************
Boot and Configuration
**********************

The purpose of this chapter is to show how to integrate and load boot loaders, bare-metal applications (For APU/RPU), and the Linux Operating System for AMD Versal |trade| devices. This chapter discusses the following topics:

- System software: PLM, Trusted firmware-A (TF-A), and U-Boot.
- Steps to generate boot image for standalone application.
- Boot sequences for SD boot and QSPI boot modes.

You can achieve these configurations using the AMD Vitis |trade| software platform and the PetaLinux tool flow. While :doc:`../docs/2-cips-noc-ip-config` focused only on creating software blocks for each processing unit in the PS, this chapter explains how these blocks can be loaded as a part of a larger system.

===============
System Software
===============

The following system software blocks cover most of the boot and configuration for this chapter.

Platform Loader and Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The platform loader and manager (PLM) is the software that runs on one of the dedicated processors in the Platform Management Controller (PMC) block of the Versal device. It is responsible for boot and run time management, including platform management, error management, partial reconfiguration, and subsystem restart of the device. The PLM can reload images, and load partial PDIs and service interrupts. The PLM reads the programmable device image from the boot source and configures the components of the system, including the NoC initialization, DDR memory initialization, programmable logic, and processing system, and then completes the device boot.

U-Boot
~~~~~~

U-Boot acts as a secondary boot loader. After the PLM handoff, U-Boot loads Linux onto the Arm A72 APU and configures the rest of the peripherals in the processing system based on the board configuration. U-Boot can fetch images from various memory sources such as SATA, TFTP, SD, and QSPI. U-Boot can be configured and built using the PetaLinux tool flow.

Trusted Firmware-A
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Trusted Firmware-A (ATF) is a transparent bare-metal application layer executed in Exception Level 3 (EL3) on the APU. The ATF includes a Secure Monitor layer for switching between the secure and the non-secure world. The Secure Monitor calls and implementation of Trusted Board Boot Requirements (TBBR) makes the ATF layer a mandatory requirement to load Linux on the APU on Versal devices. The PLM loads the ATF to be executed by the APU, which keeps running in EL3 awaiting a service request. The PLM also loads U-Boot into the DDR memory to be executed by the APU. The DDR memory loads the Linux OS in the SMP mode on the APU. The ATF (`bl31.elf`) is built, by default, in PetaLinux. You can find it in the PetaLinux project images directory.

.. _generating-boot-image-for-standalone-application:

================================================
Generating Boot Image for Standalone Application
================================================

The Vitis software platform supports boot image creation wizard for Versal devices. To generate a boot image PDI or ``Boot.bin``, you can either use Bootgen command line options or use the wizard in Vitis. This tutorial shows how to create Boot image using Bootgen, which is released as a part of the Vitis software platform package. The primary function of Bootgen is to integrate the various partitions of the bootable image. Bootgen uses a BIF file (Bootgen Image Format) as an input and generates a single file image in binary BIN or PDI format. It outputs a single file image which can be loaded into non-volatile memory (QSPI or SD card). Use the following steps to generate a PDI/BIN file:

1. Open the XSCT Console view in the Vitis IDE, if not already open, by clicking on **Window â†’ Show View**. Type `xsct console` within the search bar of the Show View wizard. Click **Open** to open the console.

   .. image:: ./media/image49.png

2. Create a folder where you want to generate the boot image by typing the following command in the XSCT Console:

   .. code-block::

        mkdir bootimages
        cd bootimages/
    
3. Copy the sd_boot.bif file present within the ``<design-package>/<board-name>/ready_to_test/qspi_images/standalone/<cips or cips_noc>/<apu or rpu>/`` directory, the PDI file present within ``<Vitis platform project>/hw/<.pdi-file>``, and the application elf files present within the ``<Vitis application-project>/Debug`` folder to the folder created in step 2.

   .. note:: If needed, open the ``sd_boot.bif`` file in a text editor of your choice and modify the name of the PDI or elfs as per your Vitis projects.

4. Run the following command in the XSCT Console view.

   .. code-block::

      bootgen -image <bif filename>.bif -arch versal -o BOOT.BIN

   The following log is displayed in the XSCT Console view.

   .. image:: ./media/image51.jpeg

.. _loading-petalinux-images-versal-board-using-jtag:

======================================================
Loading PetaLinux Images on a Versal Board using JTAG
======================================================

This section describes how to load Versal PetaLinux images using JTAG mode on the Versal board. 

1. Build the Linux images using the command:

   .. code::
   
      $petalinux-build

2. Build the BOOT.BIN using the command: 

   .. code::
   
      $petalinux-package --boot --uboot

3. Create the Tcl script using `petalinux` command from the Versal project directory:

   .. code::
   
      $petalinux-boot --jtag --kernel --tcl versal.tcl

   .. note:: The ``versal.tcl`` file includes commands to select appropriate targets and download application files to required locations in the DDR memory.

      .. image:: ./media/versal_tcl.JPG
 
4. Modify the generated `versal.tcl` file as follows:

   a. Rename `ramdisk.cpio.gz` to `rootfs.cpio.gz.u-boot` as this tutorial uses the `rootfs` image.
   b. Add the following lines to load `BOOT.BIN` to the DDR memory before the `con` command:

      .. code-block:: 

         puts stderr "INFO: Loading image: BOOT.BIN at 0x70000000" 
         dow -data -force "BOOT.BIN" 0x70000000
	      after 2000

5. Set the boot mode switch SW1 to ON-ON-ON-ON JTAG boot mode, as shown in the following figure.

   .. image:: ./media/jtag-boot-mode.png
      :width: 500

6. Configure the Tera Term serial application with default serial settings **115200,N8** and open the Tera Term console. 

7. In the XSCT console, connect to the target over JTAG using the `connect` command: 

   .. code::
   
      xsct% connect

   The connect command returns the channel ID of the connection.

8. Run the following target command to list the available targets and select a target using its ID.

   .. code::

      xsct% targets

   The IDs can change from session to session as the targets are assigned IDs as they are discovered on the JTAG chain.

9. Download the `versal.tcl` file which will load the `BOOT.BIN`, `rootfs.cpio.gz.uboot`, and `boot.scr` images on the DDR memory of the VCK190 board using the following commands:

   .. code-block::

      xsct% targets 1
      xsct% rst
      xsct > source versal.tcl

10. After running the preceding commands, you can see the PLM and U-Boot boot logs on the serial console. For example:

    .. code-block::

         U-Boot 2022.01 (Feb 16 2022 - 14:57:10 +0000)

.. _boot-sequence-sd-boot-mode:
 	
==============================
Boot Sequence for SD-Boot Mode
==============================

The following steps demonstrate the boot sequence for the SD-boot mode.

1. To verify the image, copy the required images to the SD card:

   - For standalone, copy the `BOOT.BIN` to the SD card.

   - For Linux images, navigate to the `<plnx-proj-root>/images/linux` and copy `BOOT.BIN`, Image, `rootfs.cpio.gz.uboot`, `boot.scr` to the SD card.

   .. note:: You can either boot the VCK190/VMK180/VPK180 board using the ready-to-test images as part of the released package path, ``<design-package>/<vck190 or vmk180 or vpk180>/ready_to_test/qspi_images/linux/``, or refer to :ref:`creating-linux-images-using-petalinux` to build your own set of Linux images using the PetaLinux tool.

2. Load the SD card into the VMK180/VCK190/VPK180 board in the J302 connector.

3. Connect the Micro USB cable into the VMK180/VCK190/VPK180 Board Micro USB port (J207), and the other end into an open USB port on the host machine.

4. Configure the board to boot in SD-Boot mode (1-ON, 2-OFF, 3-OFF, 4-OFF) by setting the SW1 switch as shown in the following figure.

   .. image:: ./media/sd_boot_mode.JPG

5. Connect 12V power to the VMK180/VCK190/VPK180 6-Pin Molex connector.

6. Start a terminal session using Tera Term or Minicom depending on the host machine being used. Set the COM port and baud rate for your system, as shown in the following figure.

   .. image:: ./media/image46.png

7. For port settings, verify COM Port in the device manager and select the com port with interface-0.

8. Turn on the VMK180/VCK190/VPK180 board using the power switch (SW13).

   .. note:: Logs for standalone images are displayed on the terminal. For Linux images, you can log in using `user: root` and `pw: root` after the boot-up sequence on the terminal. After that, run `gpiotest` on the terminal. You will see logs as shown in the following figure.

   .. image:: ./media/led_example_console_prints.PNG

================================
Boot Sequence for QSPI Boot Mode
================================

This section demonstrates the boot sequence for the QSPI boot mode. For this, you need to connect a QSPI daughter card (part number: X_EBM-01, REV_A01) as shown in the following figure:

*Figure 2:* **Daughter Card on VCK190**

.. image:: ./media/vck190_production_board_QSPI_daughter_card.jpg

You need to flash the images to the daughter card using the following steps:

1. With the card powered off, install the QSPI daughter card.

2. Power on the board. Run modified version of Versal Tcl from the :ref:`loading-petalinux-images-versal-board-using-jtag` section, to ensure that U-Boot is running and also to have Boot.BIN copied to DDR location. 

3. At the U-Boot stage, when the message **Hit any key to stop autoboot:** appears, hit any key, then run the following commands to flash the images on the QSPI daughter card:

   .. code-block::
      
         // check QSPI is available or not
         sf probe 0 0 0
         // Erase QSPI Flash of size 256 MB
         sf erase 0x0 0x10000000
         // Copy BOOT.BIN file from DDR address,0x70000000 to QSPI Flash address,0x0
         sf write 0x70000000 0x0 <BOOT.BIN_filesize_in_hex>
         // Copy Image file from DDR address,0x00200000 to QSPI Flash address,0xF00000
         sf write 0x00200000 0xF00000 <Image_filesize_in_hex>
         // Copy rootfs.cpio.gz.u-boot file from DDR address,0x04000000 to QSPI Flash address,0x2E00000
         sf write 0x04000000 0x2E00000 <rootfs.cpio.gz.u-boot_filesize_in_hex>
         // Copy boot.scr file from DDR address,0x20000000  to QSPI Flash address,0x7F80000
         sf write 0x20000000 0x7F80000 <boot.scr_filesize_in_hex>

4. After flashing the images, turn off the power switch on the board, and change the SW1 boot mode pin settings to QSPI boot mode (ON-OFF-ON-ON, M[0:3] = 0100) as shown in the following figure:

   .. image:: ./media/image52.png
      

5. Power cycle the board. The board now boots up using the images in the QSPI flash.
