3. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Hardware project creation and device image generation 
	- Set vivado tool version to 2023.1
	- Open Vivado tool
        - Browse to ug1305-embedded-design-tutorial folder. Go to the pl folder.Go to pl_helloworld/pl_gpio_uart folder.
	- In the Tcl Console, type the following command
			/> source ./scripts/create_project.tcl
	- Vivadoâ„¢ tool will open the design, loads the block diagram, and adds the required top file and XDC file to the project
	- In the Flow Navigator pane on the left-hand side under Program and Debug, click Generate Device Image.
