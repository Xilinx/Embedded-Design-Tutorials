# Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Processing System Configuration with Vivado

 This chapter demonstrates how to use the Vivado® Design Suite to
 develop an embedded system using the Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC
 Processing System (PS).

 The Zynq UltraScale+ device consists of quad-core Arm®
 Cortex™-A53-based APU, dual-core Arm® Cortex™-R5F RPU, Mali™ 400 MP2
 GPU, many hard Intellectual Property (IP) components, and Programmable
 Logic (PL). This offering can be used in two ways:

- The Zynq UltraScale+ PS can be used in a standalone mode, without
    attaching any additional fabric IP.

- IP cores can be instantiated in fabric and attached to the Zynq
    UltraScale+ PS as a PS+PL combination.

## Zynq UltraScale+ System Configuration

 Creating a Zynq UltraScale+ system design involves configuring the PS
 to select the appropriate boot devices and peripherals. To start with,
 as long as the PS peripherals and available MIO connections meet the
 design requirements, no bitstream is required. This chapter guides you
 through creating a simple PS-based design that does not require a
 bitstream.

## Example 1: Creating a New Embedded Project with Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC

For this example, you will launch the Vivado Design Suite and create a project with an embedded processor system as the top level.

### Design Input and Output files

This example design requires no input files. We will create the Vivado design from scratch. The design includes the processing system module of the MPSoC. No PL IPs will be added in this example design, so this design does not need to run through implementation and bitstream generation.

The output of this example design is the hardware configuration XSA. It will be used for further software development.

- Input: N/A
- Output: ``edt_zcu102_wrapper.xsa``

### Managing the Zynq UltraScale+ Processing System in Vivado

 Now that you have added the processing system for the Zynq MPSoC to the
 design, you can begin managing the available options.

1. Double-click the **Zynq UltraScale+ Processing System** block in the
     Block Diagram window.

    The Re-customize IP view opens, as shown in the following figure.
    Notice that by default, the processor system does not have any
    peripherals connected.

    ![](./media/image10.jpeg)

2. Click **Cancel** to exit the view without making changes to the design.

    >**TIP:** *In the Block Diagram window, notice the message stating that
    designer assistance is available, as shown in the following figure.
    When designer assistance is available, you can click the link to have
    Vivado perform that step in your design.*

    ![](./media/image12.png)

3. You will now use a preset template created for the ZCU102 board. Click the **Run Block Automation** link.

    The Run Block Automation view opens.

4. Click **OK** to accept the default processor system options and make
     default pin connections.

    This configuration wizard enables many peripherals in the Processing
    System with some multiplexed I/O (MIO) pins assigned to them according
    to the board layout of the ZCU102 board. For example, UART0 and UART1
    are enabled. The UART signals are connected to a USB-UART connector
    through UART to the USB converter chip on the ZCU102 board.

5. To verify, double-click the Zynq UltraScale+ Processing System block
     in the block diagram window.

    Note the check marks that appear next to each peripheral name in the
    Zynq UltraScale+ device block diagram, signifying the I/O Peripherals
    that are active.

    ![](./media/image13.jpeg)

6. In the block diagram, click one of the green I/O peripherals, as
     shown in the previous figure. The I/O Configuration view opens for
     the selected peripheral.

    ![](./media/image14.png)

    This page enables you to configure low speed and high speed
    peripherals. For this example, you will continue with the basic
    connection enabled using Board preset for ZCU102.

7. In the Page Navigator, select **PS-PL Configuration**.

8. In PS-PL Configuration, expand **PS-PL Interfaces** and expand the
     **Master Interface**.

    For this example, because there is no design in the PL, you can disable
    the PS-PL interface. In this case, the AXI HPM0 FPD and AXI HPM1 FPD
    master interfaces can be disabled.

9. Deselect **AXI HPM0 FPD** and **AXI HPM1 FPD**. The PS-PL
     configuration looks like the following figure.

    ![](./media/image15.png)

10. Click **OK** to close the Re-customize IP wizard.


### Validating the Design and Connecting Ports

 Use the following steps to validate the design:

1. Right-click in the white space of the Block Diagram view and select
     **Validate Design**. Alternatively, you can press the **F6** key.

    A message dialog box that states "Validation successful. There are no
    errors or critical warnings in this design" opens.

2. Click **OK** to close the message.

3. In the Block Design view, click the **Sources** page.

4. Click **Hierarchy**.

5. Under Design Sources, right-click **edt_zcu102** and select **Create
     HDL Wrapper**.

    The Create HDL Wrapper dialog box
    opens. Use this dialog box to create a HDL wrapper file for the
    processor subsystem.

    >**TIP:** *The HDL wrapper is a top-level entity required by the design
    tools.*

6. Select **Let Vivado Manage Wrapper** and auto-update and click **OK**.

7. In the Block Diagram, Sources window, under Design Sources, you can see **edt_zcu102_wrapper** is created by Vivado. Expand the hierarchy, you can see **edt_zcu102.bd** is instantiated.

8. Select **Generate Block Design** from Flow Navigator -> IP INTEGRATOR.

    The Generate Output Products dialog box opens, as shown in the
    following figure.

    ![Generate Output Products dialog](./media/image18.png)

    >***Note*:** If you are running the Vivado Design Suite on a Linux host
    machine, you might see additional options under Run Settings. In this
    case, continue with the default settings.

9.  Select Synthesis Options to **Global** and click **Generate**.

    This step builds all the required output products for the selected source.
    For example, constraints do not need to be manually created for the IP
    processor system. The Vivado tools automatically generate the XDC file
    for the processor subsystem when **Generate Output Products** is selected.

10. When the Generate Output Products process completes, click **OK**.

11. In the Block Diagram Sources window, click the IP Sources page. Here
     you can see the output products that you just generated, as shown
     in the following figure.

    ![Generated output products](./media/image19.png)

### Exporting Hardware

To write a hardware platform using the GUI, follow these steps:

1. Select **File→ Export → Export Hardware** in the Vivado Design
     Suite. The Export Hardware Platform window opens.

2. Click **Next**.

3. In the output window, select **Pre-synthesis** and click **Next**.

4. Provide the **XSA file name** and **Export path**, then click **Next**.

     ![Files window for Export Hardware](./media/image20.png)

5. Click **Finish** to generate the hardware platform file in the specified path. It will be the input file of next examples.

    **Note:** In most cases, we export a pre-synthesis XSA for embedded platforms because a full implementation will run in the Vitis compiler (``v++``) link phase. Post-implementation, this can be used for DFX platforms.

### Example Summary

In this example, you created a Vivado design with an MPSoC processing system and configured it for the ZCU102 board. You exported the hardware XSA file for future software development example projects.

In the [next chapter](./4-build-sw-for-ps-subsystems.md), you will learn how to develop software based on the hardware created in this example.
