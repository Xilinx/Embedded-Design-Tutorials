# Using the GP Port in Zynq Devices

One of the unique features of using the Xilinx&reg; Zynq&reg;-7000 SoC as an
embedded design platform is in using the Zynq SoC processing system
(PS) for its Arm&trade; Cortex-A9 dual core processing system as well as the
programmable logic (PL) available on it.

In this chapter, you will create a design with:

-   An AXI GPIO and AXI Timer in the fabric (PL) with an interrupt from the fabric to the PS section

-   A Zynq SoC PS GPIO pin connected to the fabric (PL) side pin using the EMIO interface

The flow of this chapter is similar to that in [Using the Zynq SoC Processing System](2-using-zynq.md) and uses the Zynq device as a
base hardware design. It is assumed that you understand the concepts discussed in [Using the Zynq SoC Processing System](./2-using-zynq.md) regarding adding the Zynq device into a Vivado IP integrator block diagram design. 

## Adding IP in PL to the Zynq SoC Processing System

There is no restriction on the complexity of an intellectual property
(IP) that can be added in fabric to be tightly coupled with the Zynq&reg;
SoC PS. This section covers a simple example with an AXI GPIO, an AXI
Timer with interrupt, and a PS section GPIO pin connected to a PL side
pin using the EMIO interface. The block diagram for the system
is as shown in the following figure.

![Target design block diagram](./media/image38.jpeg)

You can use the system created in [Using the Zynq SoC Processing System](2-using-zynq.md) and continue with the following examples.

In the examples in this chapter, we will expand on the design with the following design changes:

-   The fabric-side AXI GPIO is assigned a 1-bit channel width and is connected to the **SW5** push-button switch on the ZC702 board.

-   The PS GPIO ports are modified to include a 1-bit interface that routes a fabric pin (using the EMIO interface) to the **SW7** push-button switch on the board.

-   In the PS section, another 1-bit GPIO is connected to the **DS23** LED on the board, which is on the MIO port.

-   The AXI timer interrupt is connected from the fabric to the PS section
    interrupt controller. The timer starts when you press any of the
    selected push buttons on the board. After the timer expires, the
    timer interrupt is triggered.

-   Along with making the above hardware changes, you will write the
    application software code. The code will function as follows:

    -   A message appears in the serial terminal and asks you to select
        the push button switch to use on the board (either **SW7** or
        **SW5**).

    -   When the appropriate button is pressed, the timer automatically
        starts, switches LED **DS23** OFF, and waits for the timer
        interrupt to happen.

    -   After the timer interrupt, LED **DS23** switches ON and execution
        starts again and waits for you to select the push button
        switch in the serial terminal again.

### Update Vivado Design Diagram

In this example, you will add the AXI GPIO, AXI Timer, the interrupt
instantiated in the fabric, and the EMIO interface. You will then validate
the fabric additions.

1.  Open the Vivado design created in [Example 1](./2-using-zynq.md#example-1-creating-a-new-embedded-project-with-zynq-soc):

    - Launch the Vivado&reg; IDE.
    - Under the Recent Projects column, click the **edt_zc702** design that you created in [Using the Zynq SoC Processing System](./2-using-zynq.md#example-1-creating-a-new-embedded-project-with-zynq-soc).
    - In Flow Navigator window, click **Open Block Design** under **IP Integrator**.

2.  Add the AXI GPIO and AXI Timer IP:

    - In the Diagram window, right-click in the blank space and select **Add IP**.
    - In the search box, type AXI GPIO and double-click the **AXI GPIO** IP to add it to the block design. The AXI GPIO IP block appears in the Diagram window.
    - In the Diagram window, right-click in the blank space and select **Add IP**.
    - In the search box, type AXI Timer and double-click the **AXI Timer** IP to add it to the block design. The AXI Timer IP block appears in the Diagram view.

3. Enable the ZYNQ7 Processing System EMIO GPIO:

    - Double-click the **ZYNQ7 Processing System** IP block.

    The Re-customize IP dialog box opens, as shown in the following figure.

    ![Recustomize ZYNQ7 PS 5.5](./media/image39.jpeg)

    - Click **MIO Configuration**.
    - Expand **I/O Peripherals→ GPIO** and enable the **EMIO GPIO (Width)** check box.
    - Change the **EMIO GPIO (Width)** to **1**.

4. Enable the ZYNQ7 Processing System interrupt:

    - Navigate to **Interrupts → Fabric Interrupts → PL-PS Interrupt Ports**.
    - Check the **Fabric Interrupts** box to enable PL to PS interrupts.
    - Check **IRQ_F2P[15:0]** to enable general interrupts. The ``CoreN_nFIQ`` signals are used for fast interrupt.
    - Click **OK** to accept the changes to the ZYNQ7 Processing System IP. The diagram looks like the following figure.

    ![BD with Timer and GPIO](./media/image40.png)

5. Connect the PL IPs:

    - Click the **Run Connection Automation** link at the top of the page to automate the connection process for the newly added IP blocks.
    - In the Run Connection Automation dialog box, select the check box next to **All Automation**, as shown in the following figure.

    ![Connection Automation](./media/image41.png)    

    - Click **OK**.

    Upon completion, the updated diagram looks like the following figure.

    ![Connected](./media/image42.png)

6. Customize the **AXI GPIO** IP block:

    - Double-click the **AXI GPIO** IP block to customize it.
    - Under the **Board** page, make sure that both **GPIO** and **GPIO2** are set to **Custom**.
    - Select the **IP Configuration** page. In the GPIO section, change
    the **GPIO Width** to **1** because you only need one GPIO port.
    - Ensure that **All Inputs** and **All Outputs** are both unchecked.
    - Click **OK** to accept the changes.

7. Connect interrupt signals:

    - Notice that the Interrupt port is not automatically connected to the
    AXI Timer IP Core. In the Block Diagram view, locate the ``IRQ_F2P[0:0]`` port on the ZYNQ7 Processing System.
    - Scroll your mouse over the connector port until the pencil button
    appears, then click the **IRQ_F2P[0:0]** port and drag to the
    **interrupt** output port on the **axi_timer_0** to make a
    connection between the two ports.

8. Make the PS GPIO port external:

    - Notice that the ZYNQ7 Processing System ``GPIO_0`` port is not connected. Right-click the **GPIO_0** output port on the **ZYNQ7 Processing System** and select **Make External**.

    The pins are external but do not have the required constraints for our
    board. To constrain your hardware pins to specific device locations,
    follow the steps below. These steps can be used for any manual pin
    placements.

### Assigning Location Constraints to External Pins

1.  Click **Open Elaborated Design** under RTL Analysis in the Flow
    Navigator view.

    ![Open Elaborated Design](./media/image43.png)

    - Click **Finish**. The Vitis software platform creates the hello_world application project and hello_world_system project in the Explorer view.

2. Import the provided source file to hello_pl project:

    - Right-click the **hello_pl** project and select **Import Sources**.
    - Click **Browse** in the pop-up Import Sources window.
    - Point to the **ref_files/example3** directory of this repository.
    - Select **hello_pl.c**.
    - Click **Finish**.

3. Remove ``helloworld.c`` in the ``src`` directory:

    - Right-click **helloworld.c** in the src directory.
    - Select **Delete**.

4. Build the hello_pl project:
5. 
   - Right-click the **hello_pl** project.
   - Select **Build project**.

    The ``hello_pl.elf`` file will be generated. The next step is to test the newly created hardware and software on the board.

6.  Connect the USB cable for JTAG and serial.

7.  Open your preferred serial communication utility with baud rate set to **115200**. In this example, we used MobaXterm.

    **Note:** This is the baud rate that the UART is programmed to on Zynq devices.

8. Change boot mode back to JTAG mode (as in [Example 2](./2-using-zynq.md#setting-up-the-board)).

    - Set **SW16** to 00000.

9.  Run the project similar to the steps in [Example 2](./2-using-zynq.md#running-the-hello-world-application-on-a-zc702-board).

    - Right-click **hello_pl**, and select **Run as → Launch on Hardware**.

    If the running fails, open the **Run as → Run Configurations** view, check the Target Setup configuration against the following screenshot, update the settings, and click **Run**.

    ![Run Configuration](./media/image56.png)

    Because you updated the hardware specification with the XSA that includes a post-implementation bitstream, the run configuration sets the bitstream file automatically. If your XSA file does not contain a bitstream, click the **Browse** button to point to your bitstream. You can also leave the Bitstream option blank and go to **Xilinx → Program Device** to program the bitstream before launching the application manually.

    ![Program Device](./media/image55.png)

10. In the system, the AXI GPIO pin is connected to push button **SW5**
    on the board, and the PS section GPIO pin is connected to push
    button **SW7** on the board through an EMIO interface.

11. Follow the instructions printed on the serial terminal to run the
    application. See the following figure for the serial output logs.

    ![UART prints](./media/image57.png)

### Hello_PL Standalone Software Details

The system you designed in this chapter requires application software
for the execution on the board. This section describes the details
about the application software.

The `main()` function in the application software is the entry point for
the execution. This function includes initialization and the required
settings for all peripherals connected in the system. It also has a
selection procedure for the execution of the different use cases, such
as AXI GPIO and PS GPIO using EMIO interface. You can select different
use cases by following the instructions on the serial terminal.

The application software is programmed to accomplish the following steps:

1.  Initialize the AXI GPIO module.

2.  Set a direction control for the AXI GPIO pin as an input pin, which
    is connected with the **SW5** push button on the board. The
    location is fixed by a LOC constraint in the user constraint file
    (XDC) during system creation.

3.  Initialize the AXI Timer module with device ID 0.

4.  Associate a timer callback function with AXI Timer ISR.

    This function is called every time the timer interrupt happens. This
    callback switches on the LED **DS23** on the board and sets the
    interrupt flag.

    The ``main()`` function uses the interrupt flag to halt execution, waits
    for timer interrupt to happen, and then restarts the execution.

5.  Set the reset value of the timer, which is loaded to the timer
    during reset and timer starts.

6.  Set timer options such as Interrupt mode and Auto Reload mode.

7.  Initialize the PS section GPIO.

8.  Set the PS section GPIO, channel 0, pin number 10 to the output pin,
    which is mapped to the MIO pin and physically connected to the LED
    **DS23** on the board.

9.  Set PS Section GPIO channel number 2, pin number 0, to an input pin,
    which is mapped to PL side pin using the EMIO interface, and is physically connected to the **SW7** push button switch.

10. Initialize the snoop control unit global interrupt controller. Register the timer interrupt routine to interrupt ID **91**, register the exceptional handler, and enable the interrupt.

11. Execute a sequence in the loop to select between the AXI GPIO or PS GPIO
    use case using the serial terminal.

    The software accepts your selection from the serial terminal and
    executes the procedure accordingly. After the selection of the use
    case through the serial terminal, you must press a push button on the
    board as per the instruction on the terminal. This action switches off the
    LED DS23, starts the timer, and tells the function to wait infinitely
    for the timer interrupt to happen. After the timer interrupt happens,
    LED DS23 switches ON and restarts execution.
