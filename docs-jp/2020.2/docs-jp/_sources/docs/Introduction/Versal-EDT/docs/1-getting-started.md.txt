# Getting Started

Ensure that the required tools are installed properly and your environments match the requirements.

## Hardware Requirements

This tutorial targets the Versal&trade; ACAP VCK190 and VMK180 evaluation boards. The examples in this tutorial were tested using the VCK190 ES1 board. To use this guide, you need the following hardware items, which are included with the evaluation board:

- VCK190/VMK180 ES1/Production board
- AC power adapter (12 VDC)
- USB Type-A to USB Micro cable (for UART communications)
- USB Micro cable for programming and debugging via USB-Micro JTAG connection
- SD-MMC flash card for Linux booting
- QSPI daughter card X_EBM-01, REV_A01
- OSPI daughter card X-EBM-03 REV_A02

## Installation Requirements

### Vitis Integrated Design Environment and Vivado Design Suite

Ensure that you have the Vitis&trade; 2020.2 software development platform installed. The Vitis IDE is a Xilinx unified tool which comes with all the hardware and software as a package. If you install the Vitis IDE, you will automatically get both the Vivado&reg; Design Suite and the Vitis development tools. You do not have to make any extra selections in the installer.

 >***Note*:** Visit <https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html> to confirm that you have the latest tools version.

For more information on installing the Vivado Design Suite, refer to the *Vitis Unified Software Platform Documentation: Embedded Software Development* ([UG1400](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1400-vitis-embedded.pdf)).

### PetaLinux Tools

Install the PetaLinux tools to run through the Linux portion of this tutorial. PetaLinux tools run under the Linux host system running one of the following:

- Red Hat Enterprise Workstation/Server 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8 (64-bit)
- CentOS Workstation/Server 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8 (64-bit)
- Ubuntu Linux Workstation/Server 16.04.5, 16.04.6, 18.04.1, 18.04.02, 18.04.3, 18.04.4 (64-bit)

This can use either a dedicated Linux host system or a virtual machine running one of these Linux operating systems on your Windows development platform.

When you install PetaLinux tools on your system of choice, you must do the following:

- Download PetaLinux 2020.2 software from the Xilinx website.

- Download the respective BSP as described in [Example Project: Creating Linux Images Using PetaLinux](../docs/5-system-design-example.md#example-project-creating-linux-images-using-petalinux).

- Add common system packages and libraries to the workstation or virtual machine. For more information, see the Installation Requirements from the *PetaLinux Tools Documentation: Reference Guide* ([UG1144](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide.pdf)) and the [PetaLinux Release Notes 2020.2](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/75775.html).

## Prerequisites

- 8 GB RAM (recommended minimum for Xilinx tools)
- 2 GHz CPU clock or equivalent (minimum of eight cores)
- 100 GB free HDD space

### Extracting the PetaLinux Package

PetaLinux tools installation is straight-forward. Without any options, the PetaLinux tools are installed into the current working directory. Alternatively, an installation path may be specified.

For example, to install PetaLinux tools under `/opt/pkg/petalinux/<petalinux-version>`:

```
$ mkdir -p /opt/pkg/petalinux/<petalinux-version>
$ ./petalinux-v<petalinux-version>-final-installer.run --dir /opt/pkg/petalinux/<petalinux-version>
```

>***Note*:** Do not change the install directory permissions to CHMOD 775 as it might cause BitBake errors.
This installs the PetaLinux tool into the `/opt/pkg/petalinux/<petalinux-version>` directory.

For more information, see *PetaLinux Tools Documentation: Reference Guide* ([UG1144](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide.pdf)).

#### Software Licensing

Xilinx software uses FLEXnet licensing. When the software is first run, it performs a license verification process. If the license verification does not find a valid license, the license wizard guides you through the process of obtaining a license and ensuring that the license can be used with the tools installed. If you do not need the full version of the software, you can use an evaluation license. For installation instructions and information, see the *Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Release Notes, Installation, and Licensing* ([UG973](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bt%3Dvivado%2Binstall%2Bguide)).
