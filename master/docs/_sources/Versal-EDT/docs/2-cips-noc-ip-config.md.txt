# Versal ACAP CIPS and NoC (DDR) IP Core Configuration

The Versal ACAP CIPS IP core allows you to configure the processing system and the PMC block including boot mode, peripherals, clocks, interfaces, and interrupts, among other things.

This chapter describes how to perform the following tasks:

- Creating a Vivado&reg; project for the Versal&trade; ACAP  to select the appropriate boot devices and peripherals by configuring the CIPS IP core.
- Creating and running a Hello World software application on the On-chip-memory (OCM) of Arm&reg; Cortex&trade;-A72.
- Creating and running a Hello World software application on the Tightly-coupled-memory (TCM) of Arm Cortex- R5F.
  
The NoC IP core helps configure the DDR memory and data path across the DDR memory and processing engines in the system (Scalar Engines, Adaptable Engines, and AI Engines).

- Creating and running a Hello World software application on Arm Cortex-A72 using DDR as memory.
- Creating and running a Hello World software application on Arm Cortex-R5F using DDR as memory.

### Prerequisites

 To create and run the hello world applications discussed in this
 chapter, you will need to install the Vitis™ unified software
 platform. For installation procedures, see *Vitis Unified Software
 Platform Documentation: Embedded Software Development*
 ([UG1400](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1400-vitis-embedded.pdf)).

## CIPS IP Core Configuration

 Creating a Versal ACAP system design involves configuring the CIPS IP
 core to select the appropriate boot devices and peripherals. To start
 with, if the CIPS IP core peripherals and available multiplexed I/O
 (MIO) connections meet the requirements, no PL component is required.
 This chapter guides you through creating a simple CIPS IP core based
 design.

### Running a Bare-Metal Hello World Application

In this example, you will learn how to manage the board settings, make
cable connections, connect to the board through your system, and run a
hello world software application from Arm Cortex-A72 on On-chip-memory
(OCM) and Arm Cortex- R5F on Tightly-coupled-memory (TCM) in the Xilinx
Vitis software platform.

The following steps demonstrate the procedure to make the required
cable connections, connect the board through your system, and launch
the Vitis software platform.

1. Connect the power cable to the board.

2. Connect a USB Micro cable between the Windows host machine and USB JTAG connector on the target board. This cable is used for USB to
     serial transfer.

    >**NOTE:** Ensure that the SW1 switch is set to JTAG boot mode as shown in the following figure.

    ![](media/image19.jpeg)

3. Power on the VMK180/VCK190 board using the
     power switch as shown in the following figure.

    ![](media/image20.png)
    >**Note:** If the Vitis software platform is already running, jump to
    step 6.

4. Launch the Vitis software platform by selecting **Tools → Launch Vitis IDE from Vivado** and set the workspace path, which in this example is `C:\edt\edt_vck190`.

    Alternatively, you can open the Vitis software platform with a default
    workspace and later switch it to the correct workspace by selecting **File → Switch Workspace** and then selecting the workspace.

5. Open a serial communication utility for the COM port assigned on your system.
     The Vitis software platform provides a serial terminal utility, which is used
     throughout the tutorial; select **Window → Show View → Xilinx →
     Vitis Serial Terminal** to open it.

    ![](./media/image31.png)

3. Click ![](./media/image29.png) to build the project.

##### Modifying the Application Linker Script for the Application Project helloworld_r5

The following steps demonstrate the procedure to modify the
application linker script for the application project helloworld_r5.

>**Note:** The Vitis software platform provides a linker script
 generator to simplify the task of creating a linker script for GCC.
 The linker script generator GUI examines the target hardware platform
 and determines the available memory sections. The only action required
 by you is to assign the different code and data sections in the ELF
 file to different memory regions.

1. Select the application project (helloworld_r5) in the Vitis Explorer
     view.

    >**Note:** The linker will use the DDR memory if it exists on the platform, otherwise it will default to the on-chip memory (OCM).

2. In the `src` directory, delete the default `lscript.ld` file.

3. Right-click **helloworld_r5** and click **Generate Linker Script**.
     Alternatively, you can select **Xilinx → Generate Linker Script**.

    ![](./media/image32.png)

    >**Note:** In the Generate linker script dialog box, the left side is
    read-only, except for the Output Script name and project build
    settings in the Modify project build settings as follows field. On the
    right side, you have two choices of how to allocate memory: The Basic
    tab or the Advanced tab. Both perform the same tasks; however, the
    Basic tab is less granular and treats all types of data as "data" and
    all types of instructions as "code." This is often sufficient to
    accomplish most tasks. Use the Advanced tab for precise allocation of
    software blocks into various types of memory.

4. Under the Basic tab, select **psv_r5_0\_atcm_MEM_0** in the
     drop-down menu for all the three sections and then click
     **Generate**.

    ![](./media/image33.png)

    >**Note:** A new linker script (`lscript.ld`) will be generated in the
    src folder within the application project.

5. Right-click **helloworld \_system** and select **Build Project** or
     click ![](./media/image26.png). This generates the project elf
     files within the Debug folder of the helloworld_r5 project.

### Running Applications in the JTAG Mode using the System Debugger in the Vitis Software Platform

 To run an application, you must create a 'Run configuration' that
 captures the settings for executing the application. You can either
 create a Run configuration for the whole system project or independent
 applications.

#### Creating a Run Configuration for the System Project

1. Right-click on the system project **helloworld_system** and select
     **Run As → Run Configurations**. The Run configuration dialog box
     opens.

2. Double-click **System Project Debug** to create a Run Configuration.

    The Vitis software platform creates a new run configuration with the
    name: SystemDebugger_helloworld_system. For the remaining options,

## NoC (and DDR) IP Core Configuration

 This section describes the NoC (and DDR) configuration and related
 connections required for use with the CIPS configured earlier in this
 chapter. The Versal™ ACAP CIPS IP core allows you to configure two
 superscalar, multi-core Arm® Cortex™-A72 based APUs, two Arm
 Cortex™-R5F RPUs, a platform management controller (PMC), and a CCIX
 PCIe® module (CPM). The NoC IP core allows configuring the NoC and
 enabling the DDR memory controllers.

### Configuring the NoC IP Core in an Existing Project

 For this example, launch the Vivado&reg; Design Suite and project with
 basic CIPS configuration done as shown in [Example Project: Creating a New Embedded Project with the Versal ACAP](./2-cips-noc-ip-config.md#creating-a-new-embedded-project-with-the-versal-acap).

#### Configuring Your Design

To configure your design, follow these steps:

1. Open the design created in [Example Project: Creating a New Embedded Project with the Versal ACAP](./2-cips-noc-ip-config.md#creating-a-new-embedded-project-with-the-versal-acap),
     `edt_versal.xpr`.

2. Open the block design `edt_versal.bd`.
3. Go to the Tcl Console in the Vivado Design Suite and type the following command:

   ```
   apply_bd_automation -rule xilinx.com:bd_rule:versal_cips -config { apply_board_preset {0} configure_noc {Add new AXI NoC} num_ddr {1} pcie0_lane_width {None} pcie0_mode {None} pcie0_port_type {Endpoint Device} pcie1_lane_width {None} pcie1_mode {None} pcie1_port_type {Endpoint Device} pl_clocks {None} pl_resets {None}}  [get_bd_cells versal_cips_0]
   ```

4. Hit **Enter**.
5. Open the AXI NoC IP.
6. In the Boards tab, configure the setting as shown in the following figure and click **OK**.

    ![axi-noc-ip-board](media/axi-noc-ip-board.png)

7. Click **sys_clk_0_0** pin in the design.

8. In the External Interface Properties window, select **Properties→ CONFIG→ FREQ_HZ** and change the frequency to 200 MHz.

    ![external-interface](media/external-interface.png)

    This adds the AXI NoC IP for DDR access.

#### Validating the Design and Generating the Output

To validate the design and generate the output, follow these steps:

1. Right-click in the white space of the Diagram window and select
     **Validate Design**. Alternatively, you can press the **F6** key.
     A dialog box with the following message opens:

    ![validation-message](media/validation_message.PNG)

2. Click **OK** to close the message.

3. In the Block Design Sources window, under Design Sources, expand
     **edt_versal_wrapper**.

4. Right-click the top-level block diagram, titled edt_versal_i:
     edt_versal (`edt_versal.bd`) and select **Generate Output
     Products**.

    The Generate Output Products dialog box opens, as shown in the
    following figure.

    ![](./media/image15.png)

    >**Note:** If you are running the Vivado Design Suite on a Windows
    machine, you might see different options under Run Settings. In this
    case, continue with the default settings.

5. Click **Generate**.

    This step builds all required output products for the selected source.
    For example, you do not need to manually create constraints for the IP
    processor system. The Vivado tools automatically generate the XDC file
    for the processor sub-system when you select **Generate Output Products**.

6. When the Generate Output Products process completes, click **OK**.
    Click the **Design Runs** window on the bottom window to see OOC Module Runs/Synthesis/Implementation runs.

7. In the Sources window, click the **IP Sources** view. Here you can
     see the output products that you just generated, as shown in the
     following figure.

    ![](./media/image39.png)

#### Synthesizing, Implementing, and Generating the Device Image

Follow these steps to generate a device image for the design.

1. Go to **Flow Navigator→ Program and Debug** and click **Generate Device Image**.

2. A No Implementation Results Available menu appears. Click **Yes**.

3. A Launch Run menu appears. Click **OK**.

    When the Device Image Generation completes, the Device Image Generation Completed dialog box opens.

4. Click **Cancel** to close the window.

5. Export hardware after you generate the Device Image and click **OK**.

>**Note:** The following steps are optional and you can skip these
    and go to the [Exporting Hardware](#exporting-hardware) section. These
    steps provide the detailed flow for generating the device image by
    running synthesis and implementation before generating device image.
    If you need to understand the flow of generating the device image, follow
    the steps provided below.

5. Go to **Flow Navigator→ Synthesis** and click **Run Synthesis**.

    ![](media/image17.png)

6. If Vivado® prompts you to save your project before launching
    synthesis, click **Save**.

    While synthesis is running, a status bar is displayed in the upper
    right-hand window. This status bar spools for various reasons
    throughout the design process. The status bar signifies that a process
    is working in the background. When synthesis is complete, the
    Synthesis Completed dialog box opens.

7. Select **Run Implementation** and click **OK**.

    When implementation completes, the Implementation Completed dialog box
    opens.

8. Select **Generate Device Image** and click **OK**.

    When Device Image Generation completes, the Device Image Generation
    Completed dialog box opens.

9.  Click **Cancel** to close the window.

    Export hardware, after you generate Device Image.

#### Exporting Hardware

1. From the Vivado main menu, select **File→ Export → Export Hardware**. The Export Hardware dialog box opens.

2. Choose **Include bitstream** and click **Next**.

3. Provide a name for your exported file (or use the default provided) and choose the location. Click **Next**.

    A warning message appears if a hardware module has already been
    exported. Click **Yes** to overwrite the existing XSA file, if the
    overwrite message is displayed.

4. Click **Finish**.

### Running a Bare-Metal Hello World Application on DDR Memory

 In this example, you will learn how to manage the board settings, make
 cable connections, connect to the board through your PC, and run a
 hello world software application from Arm Cortex-A72 and Arm
 Cortex-R5F on DDR memory in the Xilinx Vitis software platform.

 You will create a new Vitis project, similar to the one in [Running a Bare-Metal Hello World Application](#running-a-bare-metal-hello-world-application), except that it will use the default linker
 scripts, which will reference the DDR memory.

1. Manage board settings, make cable connections, and connect to the
     board through your system and launch the Vitis software platform
     as discussed in steps 1 through 7 in [Running a Bare-Metal Hello World Application](#running-a-bare-metal-hello-world-application).

    >***Note*:** A new Vitis workspace needs to be created for this. Do not
    use the workspace created in [Running a Bare-Metal Hello World Application](#running-a-bare-metal-hello-world-application).

2. Create a bare-metal Hello World system project with application
     running on Arm Cortex-A72 and modify its source code as discussed
     in steps 1 through 3 of [Creating a Hello World Application for the Arm Cortex-A72 on OCM](#creating-a-hello-world-application-for-the-arm-cortex-a72-on-ocm)
     and steps 1 through 3 of [Modifying the helloworld_a72 Application Source Code](#modifying-the-helloworld-a72-application-source-code).

3. Right-click **helloworld \_system** and select **Build Project** or click ![](./media/image29.png) to generate the project elf files within the Debug folder of the application project.

4. Create an additional RPU domain for your platform (created in
     Step 2) as discussed in [Adding a New RPU Domain to the Platform Project](#adding-a-new-rpu-domain-to-the-platform-project).

5. Create a bare-metal Hello World application running on Arm
     Cortex-R5F within the existing system project (built in Step 2)
     and modify its source code as discussed in steps 1 through 3 of
     [Creating the Standalone Application Project for the Arm Cortex-R5F](#creating-the-standalone-application-project-for-the-arm-cortex-r5f)
     and steps 1 through 3 of [Modifying the helloworld_r5 Application Source Code](#modifying-the-helloworld-r5-application-source-code).

6. Right-click **helloworld \_system** and select Build Project or
     click ![](./media/image29.png) to generate the project elf files
     within the Debug folder of the application project.

 Refer to [Running Applications in the JTAG Mode using the System Debugger in the Vitis Software Platform](#running-applications-in-the-jtag-mode-using-the-system-debugger-in-the-vitis-software-platform) for running the applications built above in JTAG mode using system
 debugger in the Vitis software platform and to [Generating Boot Image for Standalone Application](#generating-boot-image-for-standalone-application) for
