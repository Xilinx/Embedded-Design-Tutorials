# System Design Example using Scalar Engine and Adaptable Engine

 This chapter guides you through building a system based on Versal&trade;
 devices using available tools and supported software blocks. This
 chapter demonstrates how to use the Vivado&reg; tool to create an embedded
 design using PL AXI GPIO. It also demonstrates the steps to configure
 and build the Linux operating system for an Arm&reg; Cortex&trade;-A72
 core-based APU on a Versal device.

 Examples using the PetaLinux tool are also provided in this chapter.

## Design Example: Using AXI GPIO

 The Linux application uses a PL-based AXI GPIO interface to monitor
 the DIP switch of the board and accordingly control the board's LEDs.
 The LED application can run on both the VMK180/VCK190.

### Configuring Hardware

 The first step in this design is to configure the PS and PL sections.
 You can do this using the Vivado&reg; IP integrator. You start with adding
 the required IPs from the Vivado IP catalog and then connect the
 components to blocks in the PS subsystem. To configure the hardware,
 follow these steps:

  ***Note*:** If the Vivado&reg; Design Suite is open already, jump to step 3.

1. Open the Vivado project you created in [Chapter 2: Versal ACAP CIPS
     and NoC (DDR) IP Core Configuration](../Versal-EDT/docs/2-cips-noc-ip-config.md).

    `C:/edt/edt_versal/edt_versal.xpr`

2. In the Flow Navigator, under **IP Integrator**, click **Open Block
     Design**.

3. Enable the M_AXI_FPD interface, and set the Number of PL Resets to
     1, as shown in the previous figure.

4. Click **Clock Configuration**, and then click on the Output Clocks
     tab.

5. Expand PMC Domain Clocks. Then expand PL Fabric Clocks. Configure
     the PL0_REF_CLK clock as shown in the following figure:

    ![](./media/image61.jpeg)

6. Click **OK** to complete the configuration and return to the block
     diagram.

#### Adding and Configuring IP Addresses

To add and configure IP addresses, follow these steps.

1. Right-click the block diagram and select **Add IP** from the IP catalog.

2. Search for AXI GPIO and double-click the **AXI GPIO IP** to add it
     to your design.

3. Add another instance of the AXI GPIO IP into the design.

4. Click **Run Connection Automation** in the Block Design view.
     ![](./media/image62.png)

    The Run Connection Automation dialog box opens.

5. In the Run Connection Automation dialog box, select the All
     Automation check box.

    ![](./media/image63.png)

    This checks the automation for all the ports of the AXI GPIO IP.

6. Click **GPIO** of axi_gpio_0 and set the Select Board Part Interface to **Custom** as shown below.

     ![](./media/image64.png)

7. Make the same setting for GPIO of axi_gpio_1.

8. Click **S_AXI** of axi_gpio_0. Set the configurations as shown in the following figure:

    ![](./media/image65.jpeg)

9. Make the same setting for S_AXI of axi_gpio_1. This configuration sets the following connections:

    - Connects the S_AXI of AXI_GPIO to M_AXI_FPD of CIPS with
        SmartConnect as a bridge IP between CIPS and AXI GPIO IPs.

    - Enables the processor system reset IP.

    - Connects the pl0_ref_clk to the processor system reset, AXI GPIO,
        and the SmartConnect IP clocks.

    - Connects the reset of the SmartConnect and AXI GPIO to the
        peripheral_aresetn of the processor system reset IP.

10. Click **OK**.

11. Click **Run Connection Automation** in the block design window and
     select the All Automation check box.

12. Click **ext_reset_in** and configure the setting as shown below.

    ![](./media/image66.jpeg)

    This connects the `ext_reset_in` of the processor system reset IP to the
    pl_resetn of the CIPS.

13. Click **OK**.

14. Disconnect the `aresetn` of SmartConnect IP from `peripheral_aresetn` of processor system reset IP.

15. Connect the `aresetn` of SmartConnect IP to `interconnect_aresetn` of processor system reset IP.

     ![](./media/image67.jpeg)

16. Double-click the axi_gpio_0 IP to open it.

17. Go to the IP Configuration tab and configure the settings as shown
     in the following figure.

     ![](./media/image68.png)

18. Make the same setting for axi_gpio_1.

19. Add four more instances of Slice IP.
22. Delete the external pins of the AXI GPIO IP and expand the interfaces.
23. Connect the output pin gpio_io_0 of axi_gpio_0 to slice 0 and slice 1.
24. Similarly, connect the output pin gpio_io_0 of axi_gpio_1 to slice 2 and slice 3.

25. Make the output of Slice IP as External.

26. Configure each Slice IP as shown below.

For building the Linux images and incorporating the FreeRTOS elf into the image, see [Example Project: Creating Linux Images Using PetaLinux](#example-project-creating-linux-images-using-petalinux).

## Example Project: Creating Linux Images Using PetaLinux

 This section explains how to  configure and build the Linux operating system for an Arm&reg; Cortex&trade;-A72 core- based APU on a Versal&trade; device. You can use the PetaLinux tool with the board-specific BSP to configure and build Linux images.

 This example needs a Linux host machine. Refer to the [PetaLinux Tools Documentation Reference Guide (UG1144)](https://www.xilinx.com/member/versal_tools_ea.html#embedded) for information on dependencies and installation procedure for the PetaLinux tool.

>**Important:** *This example uses the VCK190 PetaLinux BSP to create a
> PetaLinux project. Ensure that you have downloaded the respective BSP
> for PetaLinux (VCK190/VMK180).*
>
>- If you are using the VCK190 board, download the `xilinx-vck190-v2020.2-final.bsp` file from
>    <https://www.xilinx.com/member/vck190_headstart.html>.
>
> - If you are using the VMK180 board, download the VMK180 PetaLinux 2020.2 BSP (xilinx- vmk180-v2020.2-final.bsp) > from <https://www.xilinx.com/member/vmk180_headstart.html>.

1. Copy the respective board's PetaLinux BSP to the current directory.

2. Create a PetaLinux project using the following command.

    >***Note*:** For VMK180 board, use `xilinx-vmk180-vxxyy.z-final.bsp`
    after the `-s` option in the command.

3. Change to the PetaLinux project directory using the following command.

    `\$cd led_example`

4. Copy the hardware platform project XSA to the Linux host machine.

    >***Note*:** For the VMK180 board, use the XSA file which you generated in
    the [Design Example: Using AXI GPIO](#design-example-using-axi-gpio)

5. Reconfigure the BSP using the following commands.

    This command opens the PetaLinux Configuration window. For this
    example, no need to change anything in this window.

6. Select **<Save>**, then **<OK>** to save the above configuration and then
     **<Exit>** to exit the configuration wizard.

7. Create a Linux application named gpiotest within the PetaLinux
     project using the following command.

    `\$petalinux-create -t apps \--template install \--name gpiotest\--enable`

8. Copy application files from `<design-package>/<vck190 or vmk180>/linux/bootimages` to
     the project using the following commands.

     ```
     $cp <design-package>/vck190/linux/design_files/gpiotest_app/files/* <plnx-proj-root>/projectspec/meta-user/recipes-apps/gpiotest/files/
     $cp <design-package>/vck190/linux/design_files/gpiotest_app/gpiotest.bb <plnx-proj-root>/projectspec/meta-user/recipes-apps/gpiotest/gpiotest.bb
     $cp <design-package>/vck190/linux/design_files/device_tree/system-user.dtsi
     ```

9. Enable GPIO support within kernel configuration.

    `\$petalinux-config -c kernel`

    >***Note*:** This command opens the kernel configuration wizard for the
    PetaLinux project.

10. Navigate to **Device drivers→ GPIO
     Support** and enable it by pressing the **<Y>** key. Press
     **Enter** and enable the Debug GPIO calls and `/sys/class/gpio/...
     (sysfs interface)` entries by pressing the **<Y>** key as shown
     in the following figure.
     
     ![](./media/image79.jpeg)

11. Navigate to **Memory mapped GPIO drivers** and enable Xilinx GPIO
     support and Xilinx Zynq GPIO support by pressing **<Y>** key as
     shown in the following figure.

    ![](./media/image80.jpeg)

12. Click **<Save>** to save the above configuration and then
     **<Exit>** option to exit the configuration wizard.

13. Build the Linux images using the following command.

    `$ petalinux-build`

### Combining FreeRTOS and APU Images using a BIF File

1. Open the XSCT console in your Vitis IDE workspace.

2. Navigate to the `images/linux` directory of your PetaLinux project:

    `$ cd <petalinux-project>/images/linux/`

3. Copy the `bootgen.bif` file from `<design-package>/path` to the
     `images/linux` directory.

    `$ cp <design-package>/path/bootgen.bif`

4. Run the following command to create `BOOT.BIN`.

    `$ bootgen -image bootgen.bif -arch versal -o BOOT.BIN -w`

    This creates a `BOOT.BIN` image file in the `<petalinux-project>/images/linux/` directory.

>***Note*:** To run the images using SD boot mode, see [Boot Sequence for SD-Boot Mode](./4-boot-and-config.md#boot-sequence-for-sd-boot-mode).
